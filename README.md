## Overview

CookBk is a web app for searching and managing recipes. It is backed by [Yummly's API](https://developer.yummly.com/)
A live version can be found [here](https://cook-bk.herokuapp.com/).

## Stack

CookBk is built with Ember CLI and ES6/Babel on the front end, and Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL on the backend.
To reduce the number of requests made to Yummly's API and improve performance, the Rails app stores recipes that
have already been searched in the database.
